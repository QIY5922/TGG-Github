 TGG.news.200.d:0 "Shocking scenes have emerged from Léopoldville as a wave of riots consumed the city. The unrest is believed to have started after Belgian authorities attempted to suppress a rally protesting a recent clampdown on trade unions, with violence breaking out between police and protestors which quickly spread throughout the city. The riots were ultimately contained thanks to the deployment of the Force Publique, who used force to successfully suppress the rioters.\n\nThis wave of violent protest has stunned Brussels and the world at large, with the 'model colony' having been long praised for its stability. In response to the riots, Governor-General Léo Pétillon has denounced the rioters as 'criminals and looters' but also announced a swathe of planned reforms, including the enfranchisement of native Congolese in provincial elections, which has reportedly been met with outrage among settler groups and the powerful mining corporations."

 TGG.news.201.d:0 "In yet another dramatic turn of events in the once-quiet Congo, long-serving Governor-General Léo Pétillon has been unceremoniously given the sack by Belgium's new Catholic Bloc government. Though the official reason given for the abrupt dismissal is that Pétillon's long tenure has come to its natural conclusion, sources close to the cabinet allege the decision was made after an intense lobbying effort by the Société Générale. The outgoing Governor has been replaced with his deputy, Vice-Governor Jean-Paul Harroy.\n\nUpon taking office, Governor-General Harroy announced an immediate delay to the much-anticipated provincial elections, prompting a wave of protests across the country. Though nothing close to the violence seen in Léopoldville last year has been reported yet, the protests are only expected to grow, and neither Brussels nor their new Governor appear to have an effective answer to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
