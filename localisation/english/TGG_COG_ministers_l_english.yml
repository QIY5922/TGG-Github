 COG_leo_petillon_desc:0 "Léon Pétillon, commonly known as Léo, has devoted most of his life to the Congo in one way or another, joining the Colonial Civil Service in 1929 at the age of 26 after a short legal career. After spending 10 years in Brussels, in which time he had quickly risen to the post of Chef de Cabinet to the Colonial Minister, he requested and was approved a transfer to the colony he had supervised for so long from afar. Acting as the Chef de Cabinet once more, this time to Governor-General Ryckmans, Pétillon came to wholeheartedly support the ambitious Governor’s plans for reform by curtailing the influence of the mining conglomerates, fostering an educated Congolese middle class, and decentralising rule away from Brussels, adopting his philosophy of “Dominer pour Servir” “Dominate to Serve” completely. Having acted as his right hand for years, when his mentor left the Congo in 1946 Pétillon was the natural choice to succeed him as Governor-General, a position he accepted with a strong sense of duty to carry on Ryckmans’ work.\n\nPétillon has governed the Congo for almost a decade now, and to his growing dismay, he has not been able to make much progress in his planned reforms. Economic development and literacy rates continue to rise, which satisfies Brussels completely, but opportunities for the burgeoning Congolese middle class, the Évolués, remain scant, and the old “Trinité Coloniale” of crown, church and company that controls all decision-making in the Congo remains as strong as ever. Pétillon’s dream of a “Belgo-Congolese Union” in which Belgian and Congolese work together as equals in a self-governing Congo remains continually dashed by Brussels’ sheer lack of interest in its vital colony’s affairs, and growing annoyance at who it sees as an increasingly bothersome Governor who is making an easy job seem hard. Despite this, Pétillon still diligently works for his dream, for he can hear the first gusts of a great wind in his ears, and see storm clouds on the horizon. Unless something changes in the Congo, what is brewing might light a fire that will set the entire continent aflame."
 COG_jean_paul_harroy_minister_desc:0 "§YVice-Governor of the Belgian Congo\nColonial Administration§!\n--------------\n§LDr. Jean-Paul Harroy is not a typical figure in the Belgian Colonial Service, a graduate from Solvay Business School in 1931, Harroy would become deeply interested in ecology and colonial operations shortly afterwards, and returned to academia at the Free University of Brussels where he would obtain a degree in Colonial Sciences in 1936, and after a further 10 years of study would be awarded a doctorate for his thesis into soil erosion in the Congo. During this time, Harroy acted as the head of the Belgian Congo National Parks Institute, which he used to spread further awareness about environmentalism and promote ecological study of the Congo.\n\nFocused on his environmental work, Harroy did not expect a surprise offer to be appointed as the new Governor of Ruanda-Urundi and Vice-Governor of the Congo in 1952, an offer he gladly accepted. Despite the public reason for his appointment being his well-respected expertise on the Congo precluding any prior experience in the Colonial Service, in actuality Harroy was appointed precisely because he held few ties to the reformist administration of Pétillon, his presence serving to counterbalance the increasingly independent Governor-General as a Brussels loyalist. For his part, Harroy cares very little for the clash of reformists and conservatives in the administration, and spends his days sponsoring environmentalist endeavours and researching cures for soil erosion instead of actually governing."

And yet, that is precisely what has happened. Installed due to the machinations of Belgian business interests as a pliant figure through which they can dismantle Pétillon’s reform plans, Jean-Paul Harroy is supremely unfit to handle the rising unrest among the Congolese, being more focused on his personal projects to cure soil erosion than the duties of Governor-General. Neither Harroy nor Brussels care to consider the possibility that the situation may spiral out of control, supremely confident in the strength of the Pax Belgica and the Model Colony. After all, it's not as if a revolt could actually succeed, could it?"
 COG_auguste_buisseret_desc:0 "§YMinister of the Colonies\nLiberalism§!\n--------------\n§LIn a country where colonial affairs are viewed as unimportant and unchanging, Auguste Buisseret stands out as one of the few Belgian politicians with a keen attention towards the Congo, and one with a reformist zeal that has already made him the enemy of mining and church interests in the colonies and Belgium itself. A veteran lawyer, Buisseret made a name for himself defending Belgians during the German occupation of the country in the Great War, being arrested 3 times and even sentenced to death for his work, narrowly avoiding such a fate due to the war ending before it could be carried out.\n\nIn the 1930s, Buisseret took up the challenge of defending foreign citizens under totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and Metaxist Greece for several human rights organisations before entering politics as a Senator for the Liberal Party. Having held a variety of ministerial posts throughout the 1940s, the advent of the Labour-Liberal coalition in 1951 provided an opportunity for Buisseret to pursue his long-held desire for reform in the Congo, and so was appointed Minister of the Colonies. Since then, he has been a relentless advocate for reform, establishing numerous new schools open to Belgian and Congolese alike and pushing for elections to be opened to the Congolese. Though he and Pétillon disagree on much, they are united in seeking reform in the Congo, even as more and more look upon it with hostility."
 COG_alexandre_galopin_desc:0 "§YGovernor of the General Company of Belgium\nColonial Administration§!\n--------------\n§LAs the Governor of the Société Générale de Belgique for over 20 years, Alexandre Galopin is the undisputed king of the Belgian economy. Starting his career at Fabrique Nationale in 1904, he rose to Managing Director in 9 years and successfully expanded the weapons manufacturing titan into the automobile industry. During the Great War, Galopin was placed in charge of the entire Belgium firearms’ industry, after which he returned to Fabrique Nationale before being offered the position of Director in the Société Générale, rising to become the Governor of the company in 1935.\n\nPresiding over a vast business empire that controls around a quarter of Belgium’s entire economy and most of the Congo’s through its many subsidiaries, Galopin wields power that is comparable to Nissan in Manchuria or the East India Company in the Princely States, though restricted due to the power-sharing arrangement of the Trinité Coloniale. With most of the Congo’s vital mining operations in the hands of the Société Générale through subsidiaries like the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, Galopin is strongly opposed to any reforms that threaten the company’s interests, which most of them do, and so has emerged as a leading figure for conservative rule in the Congo."
 COG_emile_janssens_minister_desc:0 "§YCommander of the Force Publique\nColonial Administration§!\n--------------\n§LThe son of a Colonel, Émile Janssens’ entire life has been defined by service in the Belgian military, becoming a cadet at the age of 11. After an education in France during the Great War, Janssens joined the military proper at 18 and after a few months underwent officer training, graduating from the Royal Military School in 1922 as a 2nd Lieutenant and being promoted in 1925. After graduating from the War School as a staff officer in 1930, he would go on to serve as an adjutant in several divisions of the Belgian Army. Promoted to Captain in 1938, Janssens applied for and was granted a posting in the Belgian Congo’s Force Publique, quickly accruing a reputation as a staunch disciplinarian. Having steadily climbed the ranks to Major-General by 1954, Janssens was the natural successor as Commander of the Force Publique, a position he gladly accepted.\n\nDescribed by himself as a “Little maniac” and a known admirer of King Leopold II and the Congo Free State, Émile Janssens is one of the foremost opponents of reform in the Congo, making him very popular with Belgian settlers and hated by many of the Congolese soldiers under his command. Janssens is determined to see that the Congo remains on the path King Leopold set it upon and will not yield to anyone, be they reformist officials, Congolese nationalists, or his own soldiers, who see things differently."
