 USA_america_the_beautiful: "America the Beautiful"
 USA_america_the_beautiful_desc: "The United States is not merely a nation or federation of states, it is a dream. The dream of a nation where all men are created equal, where each may be unhindered in his or her search for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Any man, if he is willing to pull himself up by the bootstraps, can go from nothing to everything. That is the American Dream, and though it is far from being perfectly realised, it is alive and vigorous.\n\nAcross the world, millions look to America for inspiration as the land of opportunity, a place where they can start over and have a better life than they currently lead. Its political system, one where power is divided, law is sacrosanct, and the people are sovereign is one that inspires millions more. So long as the torch of liberty remains lit, and this ideal remains close enough to reality, America will continue to stand as a global beacon of freedom and idealism."
 USA_the_circling_eagle: "The Circling Eagle"
 USA_the_circling_eagle_desc: "Though few in the halls of Washington would say it openly, America has been able to involve itself heavily in global affairs for decades now, yet has remained aloof and above the squabbles of the other Great Powers due to the continued popularity of isolationism among the public.\n\nIt is becoming fast apparent, with the recent string of anti-colonial revolts and rising tensions in Europe, that America will have to assert itself sooner rather than later if it wants to continue shaping the future, and the public are starting to agree. It is no longer a question of when the American eagle will strike, but where, and what at?"
 USA_all_created_equal: "All Created Equal?"
 USA_all_created_equal_desc: "“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal” so wrote the Founding Fathers in the preamble to the United States’ Declaration of Independence in 1776 and has inspired generations since. It would have been a perfect ideal were it not for the fact that slavery was fully legalised and utilised on an industrial scale at the time.\n\nThough the American Civil War is long since over, and African-Americans have legal equality on a federal level, discrimination against them remains rampant across the nation. In the South segregation remains in full effect, with legalised and state-led discrimination the order of the day. Civil Rights has long been pushed aside in American politics, but with discontent on the rise, it is only a matter of time before America must decide if it believes all men are indeed created equal or not."
 USA_march_of_the_dollar: "March of the Dollar"
 USA_march_of_the_dollar_desc: "After pulling back from the abyss of the Great Depression in the 1930s with President Roosevelt’s New Deal, the American economy has enjoyed a resurgence guided by the careful hand of the Federal Reserve and Department of The Treasury, who have directed this newfound capital both into social programs and vast loans overseas.\n\nThough the City of London remains the financial capital of the world, the Dollar is slowly advancing towards the Pound’s place at the top. As the vast web of American loans and investments grows across the globe, so does its power over those nations tied or indebted to Washington. Britain and France may rule through colonies and governors, but the American way of rulership comes from the market itself."
 USA_bounty_for_all: "Bounty for All"
 USA_bounty_for_all_desc: "Created by President Roosevelt to not just solve the immediate problems of America’s ruined economy after the 1929 Stock Market Crash, but fundamentally reshape its economic life, the New Deal and its ideals have firmly entrenched themselves as the guiding lights of the post-Depression USA.\n\nA vastly expanded government featuring social security, an active Federal Reserve and extensive business regulations among many other things, the New Deal is held aloft as their greatest triumph by Democrats, and at the very least accepted by most Republicans. Unless something drastic were to happen, the New Deal seems set to remain the cornerstone of the American economy for many years to come."
 JAP_koi_in_the_ocean: "A Koi in the Ocean"
 JAP_koi_in_the_ocean_desc: "Japan’s empire has never been larger or grander: it dominates the Sinosphere, wielding almost uncontested influence from Karafuto to Lhasa, its allies in Indonesia, Indochina, the Philippines and elsewhere are on the march against the decadent, materialistic colonial powers of the West, and its economy continues to grow at a pace many would be envious of.\n\nBut for all this supposed glory, the truth is that Japan resembles, more than anything, a koi in the ocean, vastly out of their depth. Outside of their immediate sphere of influence, the most they can do to expand is to support insurgencies - of varying strength - against the West. The Imperial Japanese Navy may be strong, but it is no match for the Royal Navy, or the United States Pacific Fleet. The Imperial Japanese Army may be behemoth compared to that of China or Thailand, but one severely outclassed in many respects by the Red Army to the north.\n\nThe Japanese establishment is divided on how to approach this dilemma. Some seek detente with the West, hoping that Japan’s influence might be expanded by more subtle means. Others place their hopes in current policies, confident that, eventually, the colonialists will be driven out of East Asia. And, lurking beneath the surface, is a yet stronger nationalist current, pushing for more ‘active’ means of expansion…"
 JAP_taisei_yokusankai: "Taisei Yokusankai"
 JAP_taisei_yokusankai_desc: "More than a decade ago, Prince Konoye was returned to power with his second cabinet, his agenda to create a Shintaisei - a New Order - both in East Asia as a whole and in Japan, founded on Pan-Asianism, fealty to the Emperor and a state geared towards national defence above all else. The cornerstone of this agenda was the formation of the Taisei Yokusankai - or Imperial Rule Assistance Association - to replace all previous political parties. The theory was that this organisation would reduce factionalism and allow for the concentration of all of Japan’s efforts on the war in China.\n\nConservatives within Japan quickly became disturbed at the radical nature of the Shintaisei movement, the socialist tendencies of many of its members, and the fear it could create a new shogunate. The ranks of these sceptics were soon joined by none other than Konoye himself, who, with the assistance of his new Home Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma, reined back the Taisei Yokusankai and reduced its role in governance. This work was continued by his successors Prince Higashikuni and Count Terauchi Hisaichi, such that the organisation essentially exists now only on paper and on election ballots.\n\nHowever, though Konoye himself might have abandoned it, the vision of the Shintaisei, complete with a Yokusankai truly dominant in political life, still has many admirers in government, not least amongst the ranks of the Reform Bureaucrats."
 JAP_zaibatsu: "The Great Houses of Finance"
 JAP_zaibatsu_desc: "Since the Meiji era, the zaibatsu, vast family-run conglomerates, some dating back as far as the early Edo period, have dominated the economy of Japan, and the largest among them - Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Yasuda - wield huge influence over both the economy and politics.\n\nThe zaibatsu are at once a boon and a curse for Japan. On the one hand, their vast profits ensure higher rates of investment that can match the wealthiest American and British companies; their stability guarantees relatively high levels of employment and security; and they provide financial backing for colonial projects in Korea, China and Taiwan. On the other hand, they stifle competition, perpetuate corrupt and dishonest business practices, and interfere with political affairs. \n\nThough most remain supportive of the current system, some within the government are now calling for economic reforms to reduce their role in the economy. Others still see a model in the cooperation between Nissan and Mangyo in Manchuria, believing the zaibatsu can be “guided” to serve the state’s own ends."

 CHI_san_min_chu_i: "Three Principles of the People"
 CHI_san_min_chu_i_desc: "Since the revolutionary era that overthrew the Qing dynasty, the kuo-fu - founding father - Sun Yat-sen, advocated for Three Principles of the People for the Kuomintang to follow: min-tsu, or nationalism; min-ch’üan, or democracy; and min-sheng, or welfare. To this day, the government in Nanking still claims belief in these three principles.\n\nTheir fulfilment of them, however, has been half-hearted at best. With only three legal parties, democracy remains largely elusive, perverted by rampant corruption, cronyism and fraud, and the Kuomintang’s dominance remains uncontested for the most part. Despite some genuine efforts at land reform, promises of welfare have come to little, and poverty, especially in the countryside, remains as prevalent as it ever was. As for nationalism, that principle was abandoned the moment Wang Jingwei made the decision to collaborate with the Japanese invaders.\n\nDespite all of this, however, the Chinese people have not lost their faith in the Three Principles. Wang’s government may have failed in achieving them, but there is hope yet that, one day, when China is freed, they may at last be fulfilled.\n\n§BSAN MIN CHU-I WAN-SUI!§!"
 CHI_sino_japanese_treaty: "Sino-Japanese Treaty of Alliance"
 CHI_sino_japanese_treaty_desc: "The perpetual, nigh-on intractable problem facing the Wang regime ever since its foundation in 1940 is that of its legitimacy. Rejected by dissidents both left and right and constantly undermined by the failure of the Japanese to grant Nanking any true autonomy in handling its foreign, military and economic affairs, its unpopularity with the people occasionally makes Chiang Kai-shek look like Yu the Great.\n\nIn an effort to improve this, Japan has. since the Imperial Conference of 1942, been steadily granting minor scraps of autonomy, replacing the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Alliance, returning Japanese concessions in Hankow, Tientsin, Shanghai and elsewhere to China. The true power in most matters, however, still rests with the Japanese, and without a radical shift in policy by Tokyo, or a radical change in government in Nanking, that seems unlikely to change in the near future."
 CHI_the_i_min: "The I-min"
 CHI_the_i_min_desc: "Throughout all of Chinese history, the rise of each new dynasty has been contested by the i-min,  those who cling to the dying memory of the old; from the Ming loyalists of Tungning, to those such as Zhang Xun who sought to reclaim the lost glory of the Great Qing, to the warlords of Chihli who resisted the Northern Expedition - and now the erstwhile followers of Chiang Kai-shek who yet fight against the government in Nanking from exile in the far west. They castigate the pro-Japanese regime, labelling Wang and his followers ‘han-chien’ - traitors - for selling out their country to the Japanese devils.\n\n Naturally, the Nanking government’s official line is that these ‘bandits and warlords’ are a pitiful adversary, not long for this world against the ‘might’ of the Peacebuilding National Army, but it is clear to see, from each intelligence report out of the Burmese border, each minor cadre found dead, each kneeling statue of China’s 'beloved president' discovered in the home of an official, that Chiang’s i-min are gathering their strength, waiting for the right moment; waiting, to free China."
 CHI_mengkiang_moon: "Mengkiang Moon"
 CHI_mengkiang_moon_desc: "In the Northwest, beyond the valleys of the Peiho Basin, across the plains of the Suiyuan, Chahar and Ningsia, lie row upon row of opium poppies. In Mengkiang lies the source of most of China's opium; it is the toxic spring from which the trade flows.\n\nOnce grown and refined, the opium flows south-eastwards, into the parts of China administered from Peiping, where customs officials, policemen and cadres of the Hsin Min Hui alike are all too glad to help the goods reach their destination. Along the way through Northern China, its benighting influence spreads: bringing crime, worsening corruption and enslaving yet more poor souls into a life of servitude through addiction. When the poison reaches the coast, at ports like Tientsin, Tsingtao and Weihaiwei, it is bundled into nondescript packages and sent abroad, elsewhere, where it soon becomes the problem of another country.\n\nThe government in Nanking is, naturally, not keen to keep this state of affairs going, having been suppressing the accursèd trade in its own provinces since 1944. Unfortunately for them, the North China Political Council sees things very differently. And, when their wallets grow fat with 'tea money', their treasury buoyed by 'customs duties', and they can enjoy 'business partnerships' all the way from Changchiakow to San Francisco why wouldn't they?"
 COG_dominer_pour_servir: "Dominer pour Servir"
 COG_dominer_pour_servir_desc: "“Dominate to Serve” was the maxim used by Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans to describe his approach to colonial governance, summarising his paternalistic ideology which has subsequently permeated throughout the Congolese Civil Service succinctly. The crux is a simple one, that Belgium’s colonial rule over the Congo can only be justified through fulfilling its duty of service to its native subjects. A simple doctrine, and yet one that underpins the entire colonial apparatus.\n\nThrough this approach, Belgian colonialism holds several key distinctions from its British and French counterparts. Instead of a vast support network of local elites, the Belgian Congo operates as a bureaucratic machine split into administrative subdivisions controlled at every level by Belgian civil servants operating on a unified policy, completely ignoring the Congolese masses it rules over even as it proclaims to work in their interest."
 COG_la_trinite_coloniale: "La Trinité Coloniale"
 COG_la_trinite_coloniale_desc: "The Colonial Trinity refers to the triumvirate of interests that dictate Belgian policy in the Congo. The State, the Church, and private companies primarily represented by the Société Générale de Belgique. The state administrates the colony and reaps the immense economic benefits wrought by the companies, whom the state allows a free hand in the interior for their mutual benefit. The Church meanwhile spreads the word of God, and sees to the education of the Congolese.\n\nShared interests between all three have led to a deep level of collaboration in accomplishing their mutual aims, and as such anything that threatens one member of the trinity, such as trade unions, are combated by all three. Despite this, relations are not always harmonious, with a string of Governors since Ryckmans trying to weaken corporate influence on the colony to little success."
 COG_whispers: "Whispers Beneath the Pax Belgica"
 COG_whispers_desc: "Around the world, the Congo is touted as the “Model Colony”. Stable, prosperous and with a loyal native population. However, this image of a colonial ideal is just that, an image, with the Pax Belgica concealing several uprisings, strikes and even a Force Publique mutiny since the Belgian Congo’s establishment.\n\nWhilst peace undoubtedly reigns for now, whispers of discontent spread across the land. The middle class Congolese Évolué, long denied equal rights and a chance to advance beyond the most junior administrative posts, have started to organise in dozens of political clubs and associations. Though scant few are proper political forces yet, the situation may be more precarious than Léopoldville is prepared to admit. It will only take one mistake to expose how secure the Pax Belgica really is."
