From Mespotamian nobles, to Roman Senators, to Mediaeval Lords, every civilisation has an upper class of some form that until recently held nigh-absolute political authority in almost all countries. This ancient social order was uprooted, in many cases violently, across the world from the 18th century onwards as a result of the spread of Enlightenment ideals and the shift of economic power into the hands of the middle class following the Industrial Revolution. This is not, however, the case in all corners of the world, and in many places the old nobility retain their power, still ruling as their ancestors have done for generations.\n\nA loosely defined ideology characterised by the dominance of aristocratic interests, there is no such thing as a typical Aristocratic Conservative. They do, however, tend to follow a few shared principles. Traditionalism stands as the bedrock of Aristocratic Conservatism, with it acting as its ideological core. A distrust or disdain for “Mob rule” is another common, though not universal, factor in most Aristocratic Conservatives’ beliefs. Economic policy is a point on which Aristocratic Conservatism can diverge widely from country to country, with some fiercely resisting capitalism for the power it grants to the middle class, whilst others happily embrace it, allying with or even dominating corporate interests. So long as aristocrats rule, Aristocratic Conservatism will remain an enduring stalwart of the past in a changing world.\n\n§g“Human society is always aristocratic by its very essence; it is a society in the measure that it is aristocratic, and ceases to be such when it ceases to be aristocratic.” - José Ortega y Gasset§!"

 southern_paternalism_desc:0 "Since long before the days of Washington, the American south has possessed a far more conservative and paternalistic political outlook than any other part of the United States, largely due to the region’s plantation culture and its extensive use of slavery. Far from vanishing following the Confederacy’s defeat in the American Civil War and the abolition of Slavery, Southern Paternalism has continued to dominate the deep south, holding an iron grip over its entrenched political establishment with the Democratic Party and continuing to espouse the values of traditionalism, New Deal economics, and an unshakeable support for racial segregation.\n\nOne of the most, if not the most, conservative ideologies in America, Southern Paternalists resist social change in all its forms, intent on preserving the traditional culture of the South and America as a whole against all attempts to alter any aspect of it. The most visible manifestation of this is the ardent support of almost all Southern Paternalists for racial segregation and the “Jim Crow” laws designed to disenfranchise non-white citizens as a means to perverse the Southern social order which existed before the abolition of slavery. Increasingly controversial as support for Civil Rights increases across America, the resurgence of the Southern Democrats’ power at the federal level thanks to their championing of the New Deal may prove short-lived unless they can find a way to outmanoeuvre the growing Civil Rights movement.

Arising in the 16th century as European powers set out to claim the riches of the New World in the name of “Gold, Glory, and God” with European settlers arriving in droves from the 17th century onwards in colonies from Jamestown to Cuba. This “Old Imperialism” came to an end when the American colonies rebelled first in the north, then in the south. A sudden resurgence occurred with the rise of “New Imperialism” in the late 19th century, espousing the spread of civilisation as justification for dominance and seeking new markets for rapacious industries, leading to the near-total colonisation of Africa within a matter of decades. By the turn of the century, European powers or the descendants of their settlers had come to control almost the entire world, a state of affairs that has only just begun to be seriously challenged.\n\nIdeologically, Colonialism possesses many different strands, with each colonial power holding a different view of, and justification for, their colonies. These range from the British approach of Liberal Imperialism, a doctrine that promises eventual independence for its subjects as a Dominion once it is judged to be ready for democratic self-rule, to the French and Portuguese doctrine of assimilation that seeks to completely subsume its colonial holdings, along with its native population, into an integral part of the colonising nation.

 fascism_ideology_desc:0 "Emerging from the horrors of the Great War in Italy as a radical “Third Way” that took elements from both the left and right and promised to restore national greatness at the price of absolute obedience to a single leader, the rise of Fascism dominated the 1930s, with its spread across Europe and the revanchist ambitions of its leaders threatening to plunge the world into a war the likes of which it had never seen before. Instead, the march of Fascism came to a sudden halt, and began a slow but inexorable decline across the world that continues to this day.\n\nTotalitarian and radical, Fascism is an inherently violent ideology, with paramilitaries, state terrorism and overt repression a ubiquitous feature of Fascist regimes. It is also a revolutionary force in most cases, rallying against conservatism, liberalism and socialism in its quest to overturn the social order and replace it with its own, often hearkening back to a country’s distant past as a time of lost glory and weaponising racial prejudice. Obsessed with monopolising power at all levels, Classical Fascists often employ a corporatist economic policy, placing economic power in the hands of a few state-owned corporations, or those ran by regime loyalists. Though far from the force it once was, Fascism retains its hold in outposts across the globe, and many more regimes remain heavily influenced by its methods and tenets.\n\n§8“All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.” - Benito Mussolini§!"
